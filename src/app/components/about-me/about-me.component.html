<h2>About John Moran</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I've been working professionally with Angular since 2018, but also React and Vue since 2019</li>
	<li>I love to build stuff for the Front End and learn how the back end stuff works</li>
	<li>I'm always learning new skills in the industry and I'm always making some kind of app or feature, for personal projects or when I'm working professionally</li>
	<li>When I'm not working on something I'm researching, studying new Front End tools and technologies</li>
	<li>I live in Barcelona and can start immediately, I love the idea of working in a music related industy being a huge fan of music, rock, pop, all genres. I am a Spotify Premium subscriber and regularly attend concerts (pre covid).</li>
